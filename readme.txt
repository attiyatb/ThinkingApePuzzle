PUZZLE: Imagine you have a circle of people and you go around the circle removing every second person until one person is left.

Sample solutions: If you have 3 people in the circle, then the 3rd person will be the last one remaining.If you have 4 people then the 1st person will be the last one remaining. If you have 11 people then the 7th person will be the one remaining.

While this solution may be very inefficient, I had fun coding it.
It was also the first approach I took to solve this problem
After doing so, I was able to solve the puzzle much easier, and notice a patern that 
allowed me to reach the final general solution below. 

For a more general solution to the puzzle: 
2(N-M)+1    N=total number of people in circle, M= Closest power of 2.
