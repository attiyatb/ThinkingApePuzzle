While this solution may be very inefficient, I had fun coding it.
It was also the first approach I took to solve this problem
After doing so, I was able to solve the puzzle much easier, and notice a patern that 
allowed me to reach the final general solution below. 

For a more general solution to the puzzle: 
2(N-M)+1    N=total number of people in circle, M= Closest power of 2.
